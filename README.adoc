= ARC-Quotes

Architect app to handle quotes.

== TLDR
See code in action https://cica413h8d.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com[here]

== Dev
Project ships with devcontainer configuration. Using Visual Studio Code is the preferred IDE.   
I try to follow the TDD approach - test first - using https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tape[Tape]. Continuously executing tests while doing developement helps prevent breaking code. Simply run `npm run watch` to run all tests for every change. Since everything is done in memory test are blazingly fast.

Code coverage https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tape#code-coverage[is measured] so we know we didn't miss to test something.
